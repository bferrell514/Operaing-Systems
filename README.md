# Operaing-Systems
Operating-Systems  General concepts underlying operating systems. Topics include process management, file systems, concurrency, scheduling, memory management, information management, protection and security, modeling and performance, networking and communication.  Programming assignments There will be eight scheduled programming assignments this semester. Nearly all assignments will have a C/C++ programming components and a bash script programming component. The first four assignments will be short and fairly generic, not directly related to operating systems. The purpose of their C programming component is to ensure that you are reasonably competent with fundamental aspects of C such as pointer algebra, 1D and nD array manipulation, bitwise operators, console and file input and output. The standard UNIX programming interface is a C programming interface, and it is therefore important that you can write system programming code in straight C. After that, we will allow you to use some features of C++ where it is convenient and helpful. In particular, we will use C++ vector, list, string, and thread classes. However, don’t use this course’s assignments as a way to brush up on your OOP skills. There are other courses better suited for that purpose (e.g. Computer Graphics).  Final project The final project combine most of the things seen during the semester. I had 2 weeks to complete the project.
